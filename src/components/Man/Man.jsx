Governments can invest in public schools, provide financial assistance to students, and make sure that all schools have qualified teachers and resources. Families can support their children's education by creating a learning environment at home and helping them with their schoolwork. Teachers can create a positive and supportive learning environment for their students and challenge them to reach their full potential.</p>
